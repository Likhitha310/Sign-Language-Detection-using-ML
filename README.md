Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learningbased system to detect and interpret sign language gestures in realtime. Leveraging Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV, the system captures hand gestures via a webcam, processes the images, and predicts the corresponding sign language alphabets.

 Features

 Realtime Detection: Utilizes webcam input to capture and interpret sign language gestures instantly.
 High Accuracy: Employs a trained deep learning model to ensure precise recognition of sign language alphabets.
 UserFriendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system seamlessly.

 Technologies Used

 Programming Language: Python
 Libraries:
   TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model
   OpenCV: For image capture and processing
   NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
   Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

 Project Structure

The repository includes the following key files:

 `collectdata.py`: Script to collect and store image data for different sign language gestures.
 `trainmodel.py`: Script to train the machine learning model using the collected data.
 `app.py`: Main application script to run the realtime sign language detection system.
 `model.h5`: Pretrained model file for sign language recognition.
 `req.txt`: File listing all the dependencies required to run the project.

 Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Likhitha310/SignLanguageDetectionusingML.git
   cd SignLanguageDetectionusingML
   ```


2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install r req.txt
   ```


3. Collect Data:
   Run `collectdata.py` to capture images for each sign language gesture. This will create a dataset for training.

4. Train the Model:
   After collecting data, execute `trainmodel.py` to train the model. The trained model will be saved as `model.h5`.

5. Run the Application:
   Start the realtime detection application using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

 This will launch the webcam interface for gesture recognition.

 Usage

 RealTime Detection: Once the application is running, show a sign language gesture in front of your webcam. The system will process the gesture and display the corresponding alphabet on the screen.
 Data Visualization: Utilize the provided scripts to visualize the dataset and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
